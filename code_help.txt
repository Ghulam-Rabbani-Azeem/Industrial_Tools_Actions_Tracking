fill_value controls what happens when the target_time includes timestamps outside the original_time range

fill_value	                Description
None (default)	            Raises an error if you go outside original_time (‚ö†Ô∏è risky for real-world sensor data)
'extrapolate'	            Linear extrapolation (safe for smooth signals)
np.nan	                    Pads out-of-range values with NaNs (good for missing data detection)
Custom constant (0)	        Pads with 0s (can be useful if you treat silence/baseline as 0)

‚úÖ When to use extrapolate?

When you trust your data is smooth enough for linear extrapolation (common with sensor streams).
When you want continuous data and can‚Äôt afford missing values or alignment failures.

Use interp1d to synchronize ‚è± sensor data
Use resample to standardize üìè the shape for ML

SO BOTH ARE REQUIRED.

‚úÖ Recommendation

Use interp1d if:

Your sensors have different sampling frequencies.

You care about time alignment.

You want higher precision.

Use resample if:

Your goal is feature extraction or classification, and exact timing isn‚Äôt critical.

All sensors are roughly synchronized.

You want simplicity and speed.
